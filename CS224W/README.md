# Stanford CS224W: Machine Learning on Graphs

This folder contains completed assignments from publicly available coursework of the [Stanford CS224 - Fall 2024](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/info.html) GraphML course. The material of the course was followed for the purpose of learning the basics of GNNs necessary for the project, and because of that, tasks that are not related to the scope of the project were omitted, namely Homework 2 (Knowledge Graphs) and most of Homework 3 (Reccomender Systems and Relational Database Learning).
