# Explainability in Graph Neural Networks for Autism Assessment Using fMRI Analysis

This repository is dedicated to the undergraduate research project "Explainability in Graph Neural Networks for Autism Assessment Using fMRI Analysis", [funded by FAPESP](https://bv.fapesp.br/pt/bolsas/221292/explicabilidade-em-redes-neurais-de-grafos-para-a-avaliacao-de-autismo-usando-analise-de-fmri/) and advised by prof. [Andr√© Ponce de Leon](https://bv.fapesp.br/en/pesquisador/34735/andre-carlos-ponce-de-leon-ferreira-de-carvalho). 

It has the following folders:
- **CS224W:** Material from the Stanford CS224W Course on Graph Machine Learning, for didatic purposes.
- **Code:** Source code of the experiments.
- **Documents:** Research proposals and reports from the project.
- **Publications:** Posters and papers resulted from the ongoing research.
